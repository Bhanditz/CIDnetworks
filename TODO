Things to add:

-names

-Permutation of networks for better display (block models, etc.)

-C++ speedups for each mode.

-auto-chain dynamics. How do you get 100 uncorrelated draws? How long would you have to wait until it was done?

-full demos for each of the other data sets.

-more data sets!

-integration of simple network plots (stick-and-ball style).




Bigger projects:

1) Directed graphs.

2) Multiple network indicators/tests.
